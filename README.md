This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### README 
### Date

### Location of deployed application 
https://weatherly-7814d.firebaseapp.com/

### Assumptions made   

## Input  
When a user wants to see the local weather in any city, he will type in the location or city name.  He could also type in City name, abbr of Country too.
Eg: Sydney,AU  
## Units
For this version of the app,  the user will use metric units for viewing weather info. In future, we  can have a feature to change user unit preferences.

### TODO

The XAxis labels and tooltips of the graph could have been more tweaked for better usability. Right now, they are showing bare info.

### Stretch goals attempted 

* The App is fully responsive making use of flexbox layout and uses responsive typography for main contents.  
* User can type in any city, to know its weather.  
* The App has been deployed using Firebase. 
* The app auto refreshes weather every 2 hours using a timer.
